# challenge app
Ruby 3.0 required
as this runs on rails 7.0.3

```bin/rails s``` to get server running
go to localhost:3000 to get started
You can create an item, and assign a warehouse location/address to the item, as well as delete them.

note: i couldn't get this properly working on replit as I wanted to use the newer version of ruby and rails for this challenge as I have only used a older version before this, and wanted to see the new features added to rails.  
Upon googling it seems that officially they only support 2.5.5
